      Hello, I am Lyuben Petrov, I am an aspiring penetration tester. As a software engineering graduate from the Eindhoven University of 
      Technology, I have a solid background in computer systems, networks, and operating systems. As well as programming experience in Java, 
      SQL and Python, among others. Obtaining my degree at this prestigious university required me to build an impeccable work ethic and to develop
      a detail-oriented critical-thinking mindset.

Transitioning in the professional realm, I commenced my career as a SOC auditor at A-LIGN where I delved deep into understanding how 
companies structure their security, the tools they employ for protection and monitoring, and the intricacies of incident response. My tenure 
provided valuable insights into effective communication with clients and presenting technical findings in a clear, understandable manner.

Driven by a desire for more knowledge, I pursued the Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS) certificate from HackTheBox. 
Completing the intensive course and conquering the Dante pro lab, I gained proficiency in a wide array of penetration testing domains, 
including information gathering, attacking Windows and Linux targets, Active Directory penetration testing, web application penetration 
testing, manual and automated exploitation, vulnerability assessment, pivoting, lateral movement, post-exploitation enumeration, 
and Windows and Linux privilege escalation. I would like to obtain the OSCP and eJPT certificates next.

In my free time I like doing CTF challenges and learning more about concepts and tools of the offensive security trade. I have some writeups
and blogs set up here already and I will release more content with version 2 of my website. For me the learning never stops and I strive
to always be better and stay ahead of the curve.
