# Resume

Hello, I am Lyuben Petrov, I am an aspiring penetration tester. As a software engineering graduate from the Eindhoven University of 
Technology, I have a solid background in computer systems, networks, and operating systems. As well as programming experience in Java, 
SQL and Python, among others. Obtaining my degree at this prestigious university required me to build an impeccable work ethic and to develop
a detail-oriented critical-thinking mindset.

Transitioning in the professional realm, I commenced my career as a SOC auditor at A-LIGN where I delved deep into understanding how 
companies structure their security, the tools they employ for protection and monitoring, and the intricacies of incident response. My tenure 
provided valuable insights into effective communication with clients and presenting technical findings in a clear, understandable manner.

Driven by a desire for more knowledge, I pursued the Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS) certificate from HackTheBox. 
Completing the intensive course and conquering the Dante pro lab, I gained proficiency in a wide array of penetration testing domains, 
including information gathering, attacking Windows and Linux targets, Active Directory penetration testing, web application penetration 
testing, manual and automated exploitation, vulnerability assessment, pivoting, lateral movement, post-exploitation enumeration, 
and Windows and Linux privilege escalation. I would like to obtain the OSCP and eJPT certificates next.

In my free time I like doing CTF challenges and learning more about concepts and tools of the offensive security trade. I have some writeups
and blogs set up here already and I will release more content with version 2 of my website. For me the learning never stops and I strive
to always be better and stay ahead of the curve.

# My Story (Expanded)

I am Lyuben Petrov and I am an offesive security connosieur and aspiring penetration tester. As a software engineering graduate from the 
Eindhoven University of Technology, I have always been interested in technology. During my studies I gained software development skills in
languages like Java, SQL and Python and learned the basis of how computers, networks and operating systems work. Most importantly, however,
I had my first introduction to the security dimension of software. Nearly all my electives were related to IT security and I had courses like
Cryptography, Networks and labs on offensive security.

After graduating, I wanted to get into the IT security industry badly, so I got a job as a SOC auditor at A-LIGN. During my time at this position
I learned a lot about how companies structure their security, what tools they use to protect and monitor and how they respond to incidents.
This line of work also taught me a lot about how to communicate with clients and how to present technical findings and results from audits 
to them in easily understandable language. Although I learned a lot there, I was never truly satisfied. As someone with a technical background, 
I wanted to use my skills and my deep understanding of software, networking and critical thinking to more use.

So, I quit to focus entirely on obtaining my Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS) certificate from HackTheBox (HTB). At that point I had
almost completed their course and I wanted more free time to practise and eventually pass the exam. I finished the course and completed the
Dante pro lab on the main HTB platform. Shortly thereafter, I passed my exam. Apart from my previous expertise in technology, I can 
confidently affirm that I became profficient in the following areas:

* Penetration testing processes and methodologies
* Information gathering & reconnaissance techniques
* Attacking Windows & Linux targets
* Active Directory penetration testing
* Web application penetration testing
* Manual & automated exploitation
* Vulnerability assessment
* Pivoting & Lateral Movement
* Post-exploitation enumeration
* Windows & Linux Privilege escalation
* Vulnerability/Risk communication and reporting

Finally, I am also profficient in English and I have the Cambridge English CPE certificate (level C2). During my time at university in the
Netherlands I have communicated exclusively in English. I have read, understood and written reports, software documentation and research papers. 
I have also had to learn to understand highly technical language, summarize it and present it to a non-technical audience.
