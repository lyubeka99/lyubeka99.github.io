# TESTING

# Welcome!

Welcome to version 1 of my personal blog! Currently, it isn't much. I made it just to have a place for some existing CTF writeups
and to share my thoughts on matters related to penetration testing and cybersecurity. 

Version 2 is currently in development. I plan on releasing a lot more content like writeups, blogs, reviews of tools and certs and even
tutorials on common techniques, tools, procedures etc., for aspiring offensive security professionals (like myself).

Until then, you can find more information about me in the [about me](./about.markdown) page. And if you are interested in my thoughts 
on interesting cybersec stories, please visit the [blogs](./blog.md) page. Finally, if you want to see me in action, please visit 
the [projects](./blog.md) page where I release CTF writeups for platforms like HackTheBox and TryHackMe.

More coming soon!
