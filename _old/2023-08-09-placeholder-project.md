This is the walkthrough of the machine Mr. Robot on TryHackMe. It is an easy challenge that involves some clever enumeration, vulnerability and exploit research and some clever Linux privilege escalation technique. Definitely a fun box for beginners. THIS IS A TEST/PLACEHOLDER PROJECT TO AID DURING THE DESIGN OF THE PAGE.
